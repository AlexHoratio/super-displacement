# super-displacement
Super Displacement is a hectic, fast-paced shooter where the player's job is to shoot enemies and avoid getting bounced into the walls.

This is the source code! If you want to find the playable executable, you can at http://gamejolt.com/games/super-displacement/244666

Apart from that, feel free to poke around and use this however you want. Please don't yell at me for my awful code, but if you have any improvements, submit a pull request. 

# Build Instructions
